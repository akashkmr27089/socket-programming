Simple Mulit User communication using Socket Library ( Python )

## Stage 1 { Creating a Normal Server for sending and reciving data from Client }
In this a server is made to listen and sending data from client side. This module communicate with the peers present in the network. This is done by using two sockets created in both client and server side. By doing this, a full duplex connection can be established for sending and reciving data at he same time. This is done to make the process concurrent.
